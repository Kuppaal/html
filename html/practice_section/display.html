<h1>Introduction Of HTML and CSS </h1>
<p>HTML and CSS are two languages that work together to create everything that you see when you look at something on the internet. 
  HTML is the raw data that a webpage is built out of. All the text, links, cards, lists, and buttons are created in HTML. 
  CSS is what adds style to those plain elements. HTML puts information on a webpage, 
  and CSS positions that information, gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great!</p>

<br>
<p>Many great resources out there keep referring to
     HTML and CSS as programming languages, 
     but if you want to get technical, labeling 
     them as such is not quite accurate, because 
     they are only concerned with presenting 
     information. They are not used to program 
     any logic. JavaScript, which you will be 
     learning in the next section, is a programming
      language because it’s used to make webpages 
      do things. Yet, there is quite a lot you can
       do with just HTML and CSS, and you will 
       definitely need them both. The following 
       lessons focus on giving you the tools you 
       need to be successful once you get to the 
       JavaScript content as you continue through 
       our curriculum!</p>

 <p><strong>Features of HTML</strong>
    Considering it is one of the simplest languages to design and code a website, the language is not case-sensitive.<br>
    For purposes of keeping the language usable on any platform, and HTML is not specific to any one operating system like Android OS or the iOS; instead HTML can run on nearly all the OS.
   <br> A Tree-structure is the basic aspect of HTML.  This allows a root HTML tag to continue as an element, while child elements which  are added at any point of the structure as head and the body tags.
    <br>HTML tags shall carry display information that can be used in Firefox, Chrome or any type of browsers
    <br>Very useful for adding images, and hyper images, videos as well as other web pages so as to render them user friendly.</p>      
<br>
<p><strong>Features of CSS</strong>
    CSS is critical for website design as it helps in separating the design from the content. This helps in better readability, flexibility in programming and accessibility.
    <br>CSS files are integrated in HTML documents thus:
    <br>Internal CSS – is used as a style tag within the head tag. The advantage of this is the ability to style three or four elements
    <br>External CSS- is used to add external CSS file by using the <link>tag and will be positioned in the head tag of the HTML file
    <br>Inline CSS – can be counted as a better method to use as it will define properties  for a single tag like style attribute within any tag
    <br>One can use multiple selectors to access every element/group
    <br>Example: ID Selector(#),  universal selector (*)
    <br>Styling is defined as key value pairs, and is used to define the font-size for H1 in 24px, or default 32px.</p>
